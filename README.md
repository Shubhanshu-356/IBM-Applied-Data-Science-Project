# IBM Applied Data Science Project
# Project-Product Demand and Prediction with Machine Learning
Problem Statement:-

The primary objective of this project is to create a robust machine learning model that accurately forecasts product demand. By leveraging historical sales data and external factors, we aim to assist businesses in optimizing their inventory management and production planning, ultimately enhancing their ability to meet customer needs efficiently.

Phase 1:- 

Data Collection
In the initial phase of this project, we will focus on gathering the essential data required for demand prediction. This includes historical sales data and external factors that significantly influence product demand, such as marketing campaigns, holidays, economic indicators, and more.

Tasks:-

   Collect historical sales data.
   
   Acquire external factors data.

Phase 2:- 

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical step in the development of our predictive model. During this phase, we will focus on cleaning and transforming the data to ensure it is ready for model development. This involves handling missing values, converting categorical features into numerical representations, and guaranteeing data quality.

Tasks:-

Clean the historical sales data.

Preprocess external factors data.

Handle missing values.

Convert categorical features into numerical representations.

Phase 3:- 

Feature Engineering
Effective feature engineering can significantly enhance the predictive power of our model. In this phase, we will create additional features that capture seasonal patterns, trends, and external influences on product demand. Additionally, we will consider time series forecasting techniques like ARIMA or Prophet to capture temporal patterns in demand data.

Tasks:-

Create additional features to capture seasonal patterns and trends.

Engineer features representing the impact of external factors on demand.

Explore time series forecasting techniques for capturing temporal patterns.
